# Breast_cancer_classification
I made a breast cancer classification system using Machine Learning in python

#Project 1 : Breast Cancer Classification
* Created a system that predicts whether the cancer is begnign or malignant.
* Data set used was derived from a test known as fine needle aspiration, I used sklearn.datasets to directly use the data.
* Used Logistic Regression Model to train the data.
* Used accuracy score to judge the trained data.
* Used Jupyter Notebook for coding and compilation.
